# My Algorithms

In this directory, I explore alogorithms such as searching and sorting algorithms, and test their performances in runtime. Below there is an analysis of Linear Search, Binary Search and Interpolation Search.

## Space & Time Complexities:
### Linear Search:
**Time Complexity:** Best case is O(1) when element is found on first iteration, else Average and Worst case time complexities are O(n)<br/>
**Space Complexity:** O(1), not requiring additional space/memory.

### Binary Search:
**Time Complexity:** Best case is O(1) when element is found on first iteration, else Average and Worst case time complexities are O(logn)<br/>
**Space Complexity:** O(1), in-place algorithm not requiring extra space/memory.

### Interpolation Search:
**Time Complexity:** Best case is O(1) when element is found on first iteration,Average case is O(log(logn)) and Worst Case O(n) when the sort is performing poorly. <br/>
**Space Complexity:** O(1), in-place algorithm not requiring extra space/memory.
